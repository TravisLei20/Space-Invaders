# Space Invaders

## Description
I created a Space Invaders project using a PYNQ board, where I wrote custom drivers in C to connect the switches, buttons, and sounds. As the player progresses, the game speeds up, adding more challenge and excitement. I also implemented a feature to track high scores, giving it a competitive edge and encouraging replayability. This project allowed me to combine hardware and software integration, creating a fun and interactive gaming experience primarily using C on the PYNQ platform.
