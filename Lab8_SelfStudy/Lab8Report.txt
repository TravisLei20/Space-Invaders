Topic: AI and Embedded Systems

How it relates to the class (1 sentence): It could be possilbe that AI enhanced embedded systems 
could make real-time decisions instead of consulting a centralized server.

Summary of what you learned (200-250 words):
    Thought I’d jump on the AI bandwagon and learn more about AI and its effect on embedded systems. 
I learned that “Embedded AI” systems is not something new but just something that is getting better 
with the advancement of AI in the past year or so. In the past embedded systems simply used algorithms 
to perform specific tasks. However, with newer AI and ML advancements those systems would now be able 
to learn and improve over time. 

    The goal of an embedded AI system is to use analyzed data, gathered from the device’s sensors, to 
make decisions in real-time. This would not only allow the device to improve on its own but it would 
also reduce human errors that were initially introduced in these systems. The embedded AI application 
would run on a microcontroller in the device and not in the cloud. 

    There are a few problems/issues with AI being integrated into embedded systems. A few of these 
being data privacy and security risks, reliability and safety concerns, along with legal and ethical 
issues. Recently, self-driving cars with embedded AI in them have been the topic of discussion. What 
would happen if the AI/car makes a mistake and someone is hurt? Who is at fault if an accident occurs? 
These questions aren’t unique to the self-driving cars topic.
